🌟 Verilog Odyssey – Designing Tomorrow’s Circuits
Hello, I’m Hodar Meet!Join me on my journey to master Verilog/SystemVerilog and conquer the VLSI world, one project at a time.


🚀 What’s This All About?
This repo is my sandbox for learning Verilog and SystemVerilog through hands-on projects. From basic gates to RTL designs, I’m building skills to break into VLSI.
What You’ll Find:  

Clean, beginner-friendly projects with testbenches  
A clear path from logic gates to advanced designs  
My stepping stones to a VLSI career
