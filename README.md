# HDL Learning 🧠🔧

A collection of beginner-level Verilog projects created as part of my journey to build a career in the **VLSI and semiconductor industry**.

All designs are simulated using **Icarus Verilog** and waveform outputs are viewed using **GTKWave**. Projects include both **gate-level** and **behavioral modeling**.

## 📷 Waveform Outputs

Each folder contains:
- `testbench.v` with `.vcd` file
- Screenshots of waveform outputs under `/images`
- Simulation using `iverilog` and `gtkwave`

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Compile
iverilog -o output testbench.v main_design.v

# Simulate
vvp output

# View waveform (after testbench generates .vcd)
gtkwave output.vcd
````
