🌐 Verilog Vision – Building Blocks of VLSI
Hey there! Welcome to my Verilog/SystemVerilog journey!By Hodar Meet – Passionate about crafting digital designs and diving into the VLSI world.


🚀 What's This Repo?
This is my space to explore Verilog and SystemVerilog through hands-on projects. From logic gates to RTL designs, I’m learning, coding, and simulating my way to a VLSI career.
What’s inside?  

Beginner-to-intermediate projects with clear code  
Testbenches for every module  
A showcase of my VLSI learning path
