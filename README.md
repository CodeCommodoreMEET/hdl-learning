Building VLSI Dreams
Hey there! I’m Hodar Meet.I’m on a mission to master Verilog/SystemVerilog and break into the VLSI world with hands-on projects.


About This Repo
This is my learning hub for Verilog and SystemVerilog, where I’m building projects from scratch to grow my VLSI skills. From gates to RTL, it’s all here!
What’s Inside:  

Beginner projects with testbenches  
A clear progression toward advanced designs  
My journey to becoming a VLSI pro
