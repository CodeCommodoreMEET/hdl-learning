🌟 Verilog Voyage – Crafting the Future of Digital Design
Welcome to my Verilog/SystemVerilog adventure!Designed by Hodar Meet – A dedicated learner passionate about VLSI and digital design.


✨ What's This Journey About?
This repository is my creative space for mastering Verilog and SystemVerilog through practical projects. From simple gates to advanced RTL designs, I’m building a strong foundation to launch a career in VLSI.
Why dive in?  

Clear, beginner-friendly Verilog projects with testbenches  
A structured path from combinational logic to complex protocols  
A window into my growth as a future VLSI engineer
